# DtreeVSRandomforest_lendingProject


# Overview

This project focuses on predicting loan repayment outcomes based on various lending information features. The primary objective is to assist investors in making informed decisions about granting loans by leveraging machine learning models.

# Dataset
The dataset used for this project contains a comprehensive set of lending information, including borrower details, financial metrics, and historical data on loan outcomes.

# Methodology
``Feature Engineering``
Careful analysis and preprocessing of the dataset were conducted to handle missing values, outliers, and categorical variables.
Key features, such as income, credit score, loan amount, and employment status, were selected as input variables for the predictive models.
Model Selection
Two machine learning models were implemented and compared:

``Decision Tree``

Achieved an accuracy of 76%.
Decision trees were chosen for their interpretability and ability to capture decision-making processes in a transparent manner.

``Random Forest``

Outperformed the decision tree with an accuracy of 85%.
Random Forest, an ensemble method, was selected to enhance predictive performance by combining multiple decision trees.

# Model Evaluation
Both models were evaluated using standard metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
The Random Forest model demonstrated superior predictive accuracy, making it the preferred choice for this loan default prediction task.

# Results
Decision Tree Accuracy: 76%
Random Forest Accuracy: 85%

# Conclusion
This project provides valuable insights into predicting loan default outcomes, aiding investors in making more informed decisions. The Random Forest model, with its superior accuracy, stands out as the recommended choice for predicting loan repayment status.
